\title{Extract data from CEPESPData}
\usage{
get_cepespdata(year, position, regional_aggregation = "Municipality",
  political_aggregation = "Candidate", state = "all", cached = FALSE,
  columns_list = list(), party = NULL, candidate_number = NULL)

get_votes(year, position, regional_aggregation = "Municipality",
  state = "all", cached = FALSE, columns_list = list(), party = NULL,
  candidate_number = NULL)

get_candidates(year, position, cached = FALSE, columns_list = list(),
  party = NULL, candidate_number = NULL)

get_coalitions(year, position, cached = FALSE, columns_list = list(),
  party = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{a integer scalar}

\item{position}{a character or intecer scalar with the correpondend political contest position}

\item{regional_aggregation}{character with desired regional aggregation}

\item{political_aggregation}{character with desired political aggregation}

\item{state}{character vector}

\item{cached}{a logical scalar. If TRUE, \code{cepespdata} will store the dataset inside your computes. Thus, if the same request is made, the data will be immediately available. Note that if you use this feature the app will create a sub-directory /static/cache of your working directory to store the downloaded data.}

\item{columns_list}{a list with the columns needed. If supplied, \code{cepespdata} will return only the specified variables}

\item{party}{Optional character with a specified party}

\item{candidate_number}{Optional integer scalar}
}
\description{
The get_* functions from cepespR extract alternative slices of
the processed TSE avaiable at CEPESPData. They by default only need
an year and a position.

* \code{get_cepespdata()} is the most comprehensive function which
    merges data on election results, candidates and coalitions to
    enable more complex analysis.

* \code{get_votes()}details about the number of votes won by each
    candidate in a specific election.

* \code{get_candidates()} details about the characteristics of individual
    candidates competing in an election.

* \code{get_coalitions()} details about the parties that constitute each
    coalition that competed in each election.
}
\section{Warning}{


\code{get_cepespdata()} is a function in development. Thus, merges performed by it remain
 imperfect due to errors in the underlying TSE data and so this function should be
 treated as beta and used with caution.
}

\section{Selecting Variables}{


The default setting is for the function to return all the available variables (columns).
To select specific variables and limit the size of the request, you can specify a list
of required columns in the columns_list property. The specific columns available depend
on the political and regional aggregation selected so you are advised to refer to the API
documentation at \url{https://github.com/Cepesp-Fgv/cepesp-rest} for further details.
}

\section{Filters}{

To limit the size of the data returned by the API, the request can be filtered to
return data on specific units: By state (using the two-letter abbreviation, eg. "RJ");
by party (using the two-digit official party number, eg. 45), or by candidate number.
}

\section{Cache}{

Each time a request is made to the cepesp-R API, the specific dataset is constructed
and downloaded to your local system. To limit processing and bandwidth utilization,
the cepesp-R package includes the option to cache your requests so that they are stored
locally and immediately available when that request is repeated.

Note that if you use this feature the app will create a sub-directory /static/cache of
your working directory to store the downloaded data. You can manually delete this data to
force a new download the next time the same request is made.
